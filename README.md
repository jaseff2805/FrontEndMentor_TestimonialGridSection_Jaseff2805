## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS Custom Properties (Variables)
- CSS Grid
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Bootstrap 5
- Modern CSS features (`clamp()`, logical properties)
- Accessible markup and scalable CSS architecture

---

### What I Learned

In this project, I reinforced how much impact **CSS architecture** has on the final result, even when the HTML structure is relatively simple.

Key learnings include:

- How to use **CSS custom properties (`--variables`)** to create a centralized and scalable design system.
- Structuring components using a **base + modifier pattern** (`.t-card` and `.t-card--variant`) inspired by BEM methodology.
- Leveraging **CSS Grid with `grid-template-areas`** to reproduce complex editorial layouts cleanly and efficiently.
- Using modern CSS functions like `clamp()` to create fluid, responsive spacing and typography without excessive media queries.
- Understanding how small visual details (shadows, opacity, decorative pseudo-elements) significantly enhance perceived quality.

This project confirmed that well-structured CSS is often the key difference between a layout that “works” and one that truly matches the intended design.

---

### Continued Development

In future projects, I want to continue focusing on:

- Refining CSS architecture for scalability and maintainability
- Exploring deeper accessibility improvements (ARIA roles, contrast validation)
- Reducing custom CSS further by leveraging Bootstrap utilities more effectively
- Building small reusable design systems based on CSS variables
