                        more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

                        “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a
                        transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
                        for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
                        The next 12 weeks was the best – and most grueling – time of my life. Since completing
                        the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.

                        “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some
                        structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was
                        encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things
                        about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very
                        hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in
                        particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no
                        tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an
                        example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack
                        developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”
